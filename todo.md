to do list:
1. scarp the site each letter, each page and auto letter switch at end of pages
2. find all and add only urls that end in "-epub" or "-mobi" or "-pdf"
3. append them to txt file list
4. sort and clean up url duplicates
5. feed list to scrapper

optional:
find a way to link url to file so check if already downlaoded is easier (maybe save file with url page name).
